# GalaXee

GalaXee is a simple application written in Swift to showcase my skill of making API calls.
In this application I used the NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API.

Implemented the Delegate Design pattern in this application.

This application calls the NASA's API and gets the picture on a random date as well as the description for that picture.
